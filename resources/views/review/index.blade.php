                <p>
                    Bloom Beauty offers the possibility to post reviews on its website <a href="">www.bloombeauty.com</a> and its mobile application intended for use on compatible iOS and Android devices (hereinafter referred to as the "Site").
                </p>

                <p>
                    Publishing a review on the Site implies acceptance and compliance with these terms and conditions (hereinafter the "Review Terms"). Bloom Beauty reserves the right to modify them without prior notice. Where applicable, Bloom Beauty will inform the consumer by updating the date at the bottom of these Review Terms and, in some cases, by providing additional notifications (e.g., posting an announcement on the homepage of our Site or sending an email to the consumer).
                </p>

                <h3 class="fw-bold py-3">Article 1 – Purpose of the Review Function on the Site</h3>

                <p>1.1 The review function allows users to leave reviews, recommendations, suggestions, insights, information, and feedback regarding the products distributed by Bloom Beauty and to rate them on a scale from one star ("Poor") to five stars ("Excellent").</p>

                <p>
                    1.2 Bloom Beauty provides users (hereinafter "Users") with an area to store only their opinions for the purpose of their dissemination across all current and future public communication channels of Bloom Beauty, including but not limited to electronic communication services (particularly the e-commerce sites of the Bloom Beauty Group and/or any adaptations on mobile devices) and marketing and/or advertising media (emails, mailings, online advertising banners, in-store promotional materials, etc.) featuring Bloom Beauty products.
                </p>

                <h3 class="fw-bold py-3">Article 2 – Review Submission, Badges, and Ratings</h3>

                <p>2.1 Any User under the age of 16 must obtain prior authorization from a parent or legal guardian to post a review on the Site and accept the Review Terms. Bloom Beauty may request proof of such authorization from any minor User and, without such proof, may refuse to publish a review.</p>

                <p>2.2 Users may express their opinions as follows:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spontaneously, on their own initiative, by clicking "Express your opinion" on the product page in question. In this case, Bloom Beauty cannot guarantee that the User has actually purchased or tested the product. These reviews either have no specific badge or are labeled with the "spontaneous review" badge.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Following an invitation email sent by Bloom Beauty to review a purchased product. Since these reviews are solicited after a purchase, they are identified on the Site with a "verified buyer" badge.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        As part of a trial campaign in which Users receive sample-size or full-size products for testing before writing a review. A specific submission link allows Bloom Beauty to identify them and attach the "tester review" badge to their review. This badge informs users that a consideration was provided in exchange for the review and ensures traceability.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>2.3 By default, reviews are displayed in chr class=""onological order, from most recent to oldest, but Users can choose to view them based on other criteria such as usefulness or rating.</p>
